# MyProject

Aaron Villalobos
Project Overview: This project will be a basic business website that the customer or future customer
                  can navigate to find deals, location, menu items, pricing, and how to contact the 
                  the restaurant.

Details: Website visitors will be able to navigate the website by using links for deals, location, and
         contact.  There will be a contact form that visitors will be able to fill out to sign up 
         for coupons, online deals, or for general inquiries.  The location page will have a link where
         customers can call the restaurant.  The menu and pricing page will give website visitors access
         to view food & prices.   


Technologies Used:  .html, .css, and .js.


Ideas For Future Improvement:  Would like to create a capability to where website visitors can order
                               order online and be able to pay online.  Would like a feature where
                               you can add coupon codes that can subtract from the total so customers
                               can see how much they saved.
